  <h1>John Bradley</h1>
  <br>
  <p>My philosophy is <em>why buy it if I can make it myself</em>. Combining
    this idea, with my education in design, computing, and engineering; I have
    learnt many practical and design skills. This includes building my own
    computers and various other
    hardware including 3D printers. I machine
    <a href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/OreRings">Titanium wedding bands</a>,
    make <a href="artwork.html">artwork</a> for my home, repair home appliances.
     More recently I decided to start making my own computer programs and games.
      Over the years I have found that I can turn my hand to
    just about any task and learn new skills quickly.</p>
